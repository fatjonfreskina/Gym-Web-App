## Description the web-app

This app is designed to managed everything related to a gym. Starting from the gym itself to the people that work there and also to the users that want to attend courses offered by the gym.
The goal is to design a web application in order for those people to be able to simplify their tasks both on the workers side but also on the gym members side. 


To make this webapp working correctly you need to :
- create a folder inside the tomcat web server installation folder called "gwa"
- then go inside gwa and create two other subdirectories called : "avatars" and "medical_certificates"

Before using this webapp you have to create and eventually populate the database.
You can follow the instructions in src/main/java/database/README.md.
We have also created a Java class with path src/main/java/database/DataBaseUtils.java which allows you to create and populate your local database easily.
