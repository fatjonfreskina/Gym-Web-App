Here, there is the Class Diagram that handles the Trainee Resource (Dao omitted due to space). As we can see there are 5 main servlets for this resource : TraineeAvailableSlotsServlet, TraineeDeleteReservationServlet, GetReservationServlet, TraineeNewReservationServlet, TraineeServlet. The first four Servlet are used to manage the main operation that a trainee can do, while the first one manage the Trainee page generally.
